Single-color LED candle flicker with Circuit Python using built-in modules. No external libraries required. 

Highly recommend you use a warm white LED instead of cool white LED it's easier on the eyes.

# Required Hardware
- 2-pin LED
- Any Adafruit Microcontroller

Instructions: Attach the shorter leg of the LED to the GND terminal and longer leg to any analog pin usually labeled 
A0, A1, etc..

With the Gemma M0 I'm using GND and pin D1/A0
